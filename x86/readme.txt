If you're new to x86-64, you should read the source code
in the following order:

   - add for basic x86 syntax
   - branch for implementation of conditional branches
   - fact for implementation of loops
   - arrays for memory access
   - fibo for recursion
   - sort for insertion sort (no x86 assembly code yet)
